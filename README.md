# iHateDouyin
It started when certain people got upset at seeing certain behaviors of playing Douyin on public computers (especially on school class computers) and wanted to design a program to stop them from playing Douyin.

Function: When the program runs, if this computer is accessing Douyin, crash the computer.

**WARNING: This program is intended for testing and recreational use only, there is a possibility of data loss and hardware damage, the author of the project will not be held responsible for any damage caused.**

Runtime:
You need to install **.NET Framework 4.8 Runtime** and **DotNet Core Runtime 8** first to use this software.
We can only detect Douyin in Microsoft Edge. If you want this software detect URLs in Google Chrome and Firefox, you can wait or make contributions.
If you want to edit the code, you may need **Visual Studio 2022** , Rider may be good but we don't recommend it.
