# iHateDouyin
It started when certain people got upset at seeing certain behaviors of playing Douyin on public computers (especially on school class computers) and wanted to design a program to stop them from playing Douyin.

This Project uses C# and .NET to develop.

Function: When the program runs, if this computer is accessing Douyin, crash the computer.

**WARNING: This program is intended for testing and recreational use only, there is a possibility of data loss and hardware damage, the author of the project will not be held responsible for any damage caused.**

Requirements:
You need to install **.NET Framework 4.8 Runtime** and **DotNet Core Runtime 8** first to use this software. If you would like to edit the project, you need **Visual Studio 2022** ***Community*** with **.NET Development Tools** to open and edit it.

PS: We can only detect Douyin in Microsoft Edge. If you want this software detect URLs in Google Chrome and Firefox, you can wait or make contributions.
