# iHateDouyin
It started when certain people got upset at seeing certain behaviors of playing Douyin on public computers (especially on school class computers) and wanted to design a program to stop them from playing Douyin.

This Project uses C# and .NET to develop.

Function: When the program runs, if this computer is accessing Douyin, crash the computer.

**WARNING: This program is intended for testing and recreational use only, there is a possibility of data loss and hardware damage, the author of the project will not be held responsible for any damage caused.**

Requirements:
You need to install **.NET Framework 4.7.2 Runtime** first to use this software. If you would like to edit the project, you need **Visual Studio 2022** ***Community*** with **.NET Development Tools** to open and edit it.


PS: We can only detect Douyin in Microsoft Edge. If you want this software detect URLs in Google Chrome and Firefox, you can wait or make contributions.

**Do not use git clone, git pull, or git push to edit this project's code on macOS!**  
If you must edit it this way, then after committing your changes, **please remove all ".DS_Store" files and "_MACOSX" folders from the committed files.**  
We don't want these garbages messing up our project!
